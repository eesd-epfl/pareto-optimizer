# Codes: Pareto-like Sequential Sampling (PSS) Approach for Global Optimization

This repository holds the source code for the new optimization algorithm Pareto-like Sequential Sampling (PSS).
C++14, Python3.7 and Octave (Matlab) codes have been provided.
This code is part of a published manuscript at Soft Computing journal:[Pareto-like sequential sampling heuristic for global optimisation (open access)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-021-05853-8).
The full and complete implementation for the algorithm and the benchmarks shall be found in the C++14 version of the algorithm.
The files that start with "Main" are the main files and have detailed instructions on how to run and use the proposed algorithm.
Also refer to the paper for parameter-settings explanintion.

Please report any bugs to: [Mahmoud S. Shaqfa](mailto:mahmoud.shaqfa@epfl.ch?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Pareto%20Optimizer).
